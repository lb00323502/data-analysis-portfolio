# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio. I'm transitioning from a scientific background (Raman spectroscopy) into data analytics and AI engineering.  
This repository includes sample projects using Python, demonstrating my skills in PCA, classification models, and scientific data interpretation.

## ðŸ”¬ Project 1: Raman Spectroscopy Simulation with PCA and LDA

This project simulates high-dimensional spectral data and applies PCA and LDA to classify it into two groups.  
Although the dataset is synthetic, the workflow reflects real-world signal processing Iâ€™ve worked on in the lab.

**Skills used**:  
- Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib  
- Dimensionality reduction  
- Supervised classification  
- Model evaluation (classification report, confusion matrix)

More projects coming soon!
